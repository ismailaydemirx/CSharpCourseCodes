# C# Course Codes

This repository currently showcases Design Patterns in C#. However, I will personally be uploading more content related to various other topics soon as part of the C# course practices. Stay tuned for an expanded and diverse set of resources crafted by me to enrich your learning journey!



## Contents

The repository consists of the following main folders and files:

- **DesignPatterns**: This folder contains files related to design patterns used in the project. It includes a subfolder named `.vs` which contains Visual Studio specific files.
- **TypesAndVariables**: This folder includes files related to types and variables used in the project. It also contains a subfolder named `obj` which holds object files generated during the compilation process.
